Subject: Request for Sick Leave

Dear [HR Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and will be unable to come to work for the next few days. I kindly request a sick leave for this period.

I woke up this morning with a high fever and other flu-like symptoms. I have already consulted with my doctor and have been advised to rest and recover at home. I will keep you updated on my progress and provide a doctor's note upon my return.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter. I will make sure to catch up on any missed work once I am back.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
